## Introduction

Like you may know, I wrote a Vulkan wrapper **[CVulkan](https://realitix.github.io/vulkan/2016/12/05/cvulkan-1-0/),** which is pretty good since I use it in my **[Vulk](https://github.com/realitix/vulk)** Engine.
Recently, I had to implement a new feature in **Vulk**: detect when the window is resized and reload all Vulkan pipelines.
Sadly, **CVulkan** was bugged. So I came back to the code, and I had to remember architecture of this complex C code generator.
But instead of suffer in silence, I thought: no way, it's too dificult to maintain.
**[vulkan](https://github.com/realitix/vulkan)** was on its way, a new shiny CFFI Vulkan wrapper.
But first of all,

## What is CFFI ?

**[CFFI](https://cffi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)** is a Python module aimed at simplify communication with C API. It's a beautiful jewel written by the PyPy community. CFFI handles all the Python to C conversion, the memory
managemement, all these tricky parts.

## *vulkan*

The new wrapper is named just *vulkan*, because on pypi, the module is named just *vulkan*, which allows a simple `pip install vulkan`.
This wrapper works like *CVulkan*, by parsing the `vk.xml` file but, instead of generating a C file, it generates a Python file (thanks to CFFI).
